                <p>I will frame the artworks, and when that is ready, I will ask you for the first payment of 50% plus shipping costs.</p>
                <p>When the package is delivered, you pay the other 50%, unless you are not happy with your order, in which case you need to ship it back.</p>

                <p>Since our customers can be from all around the world, the shipping costs will be calculated after you send the email asking for checkout or simply asking to know about your region's shipping costs.</p>
                <p>The shipping costs are paid with the first 50%.</p>
